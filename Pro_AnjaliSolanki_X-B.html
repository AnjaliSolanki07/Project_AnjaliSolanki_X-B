           <p>Equitable access to safe and effective vaccines is critical to ending the COVID-19 pandemic,so it 
           is hugely encouraging to see so many vaccines proving and going into development.
           <a href="https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/media-resources/news"> WHO </a>
           is working tirelessly with partners to develop, manufacture and deploy safe and effective vaccines. Safe and
           effective vaccines are a game-changing tool: but for the foreseeable future we must continue
           wearing masks, cleaning our hands, ensuring good ventilation indoors,physicallydistancing 
           and avoiding crowds. Being vaccinated does not mean that we can throw caution to the wind and put 
           ourselves and others at risk, particularly because research is still ongoing into how much vaccines
           protect not only against disease but also against infection and transmission.There are four types 
           of vaccines in clinical trials: whole virus,protein subunit, viral vector and nucleic acid 
           <sub>(RNA and DNA)</sub>, each of which protects people, but by producing immunity in a slightly 
           different way.Like any vaccine, COVID-19 vaccines can cause mild, short term side effects,
           such as a low-grade fever or pain or redness at the injection site. Most reactions to vaccines 
           are mild and go away within a few days on their own. More serious or long-lasting side effects to 
           vaccines are possible but extremely rare.</p>

                    <li>This continued monitoring can pick up on adverse events that may not have been seen in clinical trials.</li>
                    <li>If an unexpected adverse event is seen, experts quickly study it further to assess whether it is a true safety concern.</li>
